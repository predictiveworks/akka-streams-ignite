# Ignite Sink for Akka Streams

This project is an initiative to support stream-aware, reactive, ingestion pipelines for 
Apache Ignite in Java and Scala. It is built on top of Akka Streams, and provides a DSL 
for reactive and stream-oriented programming, with built-in support for backpressure. 

This Akka Streams **Ignite Sink** is intended to be used with reactive (source) components,
e.g. from the [Alpakka project](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/index.html).
